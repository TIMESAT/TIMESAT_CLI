Main Entry Point for the TIMESAT Toolkit

This script serves as the primary entry point for running the TIMESAT toolkit.
It reads a JSON settings file that contains all necessary configurations and file paths,
and then calls the 'run()' function from the 'timesatimage' module to start processing.

Usage:
    python main.py [settings.json]

If no settings file is specified, the script defaults to using 'settings.json'.
